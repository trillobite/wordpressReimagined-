# wordpressReimagined-

### Goals:
To recreate a wordpress-like system that is faster, simpler, and more secure.
Write ultra-lean code which is incredibly extensible.
Develop a platform generic enough to have the capability to be used for virtually any online application.
User will be able to design, and modify the content without viewing any code.
